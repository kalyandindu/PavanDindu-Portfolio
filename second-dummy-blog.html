            <p style="font-size: small;"> September, 2020</p>
            <p style="font-size: large;"> My expectations and reality from college and service based company. </p><br>

            <h2 class="header-class">College</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large;"> My initial expectation going into a university is to have best lectures, Library, Practicle exposure, Good Placement and other infrastructure.In reality teaching is more of a theoriticle rather than a practicle and also curriculum doesn't suits the current industy requirments as a result you will learn may unnecessary things. </p> <br>

            
            <h2 class="header-class">Service based company</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large;"> Expectation and reality in a service based company, My initial expetation after entring an MNC is that I would be placed  in a good devlopment project where as a code enthusiast I can learn more and prosper with my career. Rather I was deployed in a support environment where scope of learning is nill and nowhere near to current trends. Majority of the projects in service oriented companies would be of support, testing and non technicle stuff which demands freshers where work kind of would be repetative and not exiting stuff . Better way to escape MNS cycle is to learn good skills during your graduation and get into startup's or product based where your career will be sky rocketed with good learning scope and payscale.</p><br>

            <h2 class="header-class">conclusion</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large;"> Expectation and reality in both gradution and service company job were entirely different, For good carrer, Get good technical skills and get placed in startups and product based companies. Where your work will be more valued, You will learn more, Will acquire industry relevant technical skills and at the end life will be much exciting.</p><br>
